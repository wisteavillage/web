A man rowed his boat, purging into the front of an incoming atmospheric fog, searching for that glow of light. As he navigated further into the sea, an island came to view, and the same light still emitted from within.</p>\r\n                            <p>He landed ashore and traveled closer to the light until the setting changed - in terms of brightness and mood. It was a beautiful scene, wisteria vines hung down from a particular-looking tree.</p>\r\n                            <p>He stood next to it, tried plucking its children's vines, climbed and jumped to grab support - and was thrown back by its overpowering aura… Realizing the symbol and value of the wisteria, he discarded his journey in the sea for the beauty of such existence.</p>\r\n                            <p>The island seemed untouched - no sight of human presence, but it was adaptive.</p>\r\n                            <p>He became too fond of the tree and established a bond with it. He could make a living using all the abundant resources here.</p>\r\n                            <p>A group of friends arrived a week’s time after the man spread news of the island. They helped to create the civilization the man started on his own. It was habitable by the time they set foot, which strengthened their decision of a new settlement.</p>\r\n                            <p>That man was our founder (determined to be the first village head), and he planned a ceremony to be held in two week’s time after the project completion.</p>\r\n                            <p>In short notice, the man fell sick and passed away with an established will. The will was passed to his granddaughter, the current village master. After inauguration, she initiated an annual festival to celebrate the village’s anniversary, organized many social events, and validated construction of schools. The village was just getting better.</p>\r\n                            <p>And as for the Wisteria tree, it continued to sustain the village their yearned peace and growth. But, the tree remains a symbol of worship for the villagers - to wish them luck and prosperity. Its existence still surrounds an invisible and mysterious globe.</p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Village;","import React from 'react'\r\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom'\r\nimport '../App.css';\r\nimport Nav from '../partials/Nav';\r\n\r\nfunction Map() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"wrapper\">\r\n            <Nav />\r\n            <div className=\"main\">\r\n                <div className=\"row\">\r\n                    <div className=\"col w25\">\r\n                        <div className=\"post right\">\r\n                            <h2>&bull; Contents &bull;</h2>\r\n                            <div className=\"toc\">\r\n                                <Link to=\"/village\">History</Link>\r\n                                <Link className=\"active\" to=\"/village/map\">Map</Link>\r\n                                <Link to=\"/village/jobs\">Jobs</Link>\r\n                                <Link to=\"/village/housing\">Housing</Link>\r\n                                <Link to=\"/village/commissions\">Commissions</Link>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"col w75\">\r\n                        <div className=\"post left\">\r\n                            <div className=\"bookmark\">Village / <b>MAP</b></div>\r\n                            <p>Although the village is small, the villagers love living here.

It is important to Wistea that we come to assist each other during times of need, let it be small, big, personal, formal, and anything in between. Anyone can take on any of the posted commissions! Great rewards may come to those that help.</p>\r\n                            <h4>Commissions</h4>\r\n                            <p>Respectful little birds (villagers call them the Toto birds) are the lead helpers at the commission hall. A Toto will be with you and your party as a helpful guide through each of the commissions you picked up (your choice to include them on your commission is up to you). The bird has two main jobs: it serves as your character's first interaction before a commission and informs your character about the latest news (mostly from outside the village).</p>\r\n                            <p>Although your character will each get their own Toto bird, the birds do not accompany you all the time—since they work at the commission hall as full-time employees.</p>\r\n                            <p>Since it can potentially be dangerous, it is necessary for every commission to be carried out with at least a party of two (#1 rule at the commission hall!). Each commission will have recommended titles that are encouraged to join, but not obligated to. Some choices can only be made if certain jobs participate in the commission! But fear not -! For example, even if a commissioner wants a certain flower the florist knows really well, the florist doesn't have to be in the party to complete the task. Though picking out the right flower would certainly be a big help to the commissioner and they most definitely will reward you better! As long as the task is completed to some degree, your party will get the listed reward(s) with or without bonus. Failing the commission is also possible, so make your choices wisely! In the case of failing the commission task, you will still get consolation rewards so don't get discouraged!</p>\r\n                            <p>Use shop items to help you and your party out during commissions!</p>\r\n                            <p>If you're stuck, your Toto can lend you a hand! This means your character is allowed to request help from the actual Toto bird or its items. However, using a Toto item will cost your character coins, so use them wisely. Toto is very knowledgeable and can help if certain jobs are not present in the party or if certain stat conditions are not met. Toto's items can be purchased at the Village Shop (see details on <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EcEl0NibPxyfNrmhOjKKPF2VK-Bt8iSgT4Yg17ak0aY/edit#gid=1579041329\">Village Shop</a>).</p>\r\n                            <p><b>Multiplicity for Commissions are 2x.</b></p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div className=\"post left\">\r\n                            <h4>Requests</h4>\r\n                            <p>Requests are separate from commissions.

You can draw an RP from an event or from memes we will provide you. We don't want you to simply be a 100% writer so draw frequently (even if it's for practice).</p>\r\n                    <hr/>\r\n                    <p><b>›› Can my art application be drawn by someone else?</b><br/>As long as you provide the proper credit of the person who drew the art somewhere in your application.

You will move up the ranks based on your performance and RP submissions. The fastest way to level up is by completing and submitting commissions/requests from the local village.</p>\r\n                    <p>When you have moved up to another level, you will be given the role to that specific level. Keep in mind that you can only create two characters at the moment so there will not be room for a third character.

If you want to request to live with another character, the other party must also talk with the mods about this. You need to also provide the reason why you want these two characters to live together. Examples include if characters experience a financial crisis, a change in marital status, etc.</p>\r\n                    <hr/>\r\n                    <p><b>›› This group seems interesting, can I become a mod?</b><br/>We do not know if our group can go as far as being able to recruit members.

Creatures and monsters won’t be weird types of monsters that appear in anime or games. People are not limited to not being able to fight. How else would we have survived all this way to create a village? People will encounter hardships and obstacles along the way.</p>\r\n                    <hr/>\r\n                    <p><b>›› To the previous question, will there be magic (for fighting, anything)?

Its magic is unknown and we will get to learn about it in the future. And to the other question, that can be answered in the future as well...</p>\r\n                    <hr/>\r\n                    <p><b>›› Why do I still not understand what this group is about?</b><br/>Trust us, we get it. None of us understand what it’s about half of the time. But all we do know is that it is pretty much a slice-of-life kind of RP group. There will be features of harvest moon, but that’s most definitely left entirely up to your imaginations.</p>\r\n                    <hr/>\r\n                    <p><b>›› Will there be app checks?</b><br/>We're not going to check if any of the apps are lore compliant since there isn't really any lore in this group. We do ask you to send us an app check to get feedback from us, but don't be discouraged that you don't have the time to submit one. People always don't realize that app checks don't mean they will get accepted even if they did great on both application submissions.</p>\r\n                    <p>When you do submit one, make sure the mods can comment on them. Please read through the comments to understand to the best of your knowledge because it can really help you (more likely to get accepted if you followed what we asked for).</p>\r\n                    <p>If you send a Group Note on DeviantArt, we can directly give you feedback by replying. If you send on Google Docs, we can comment by highlighting a section from the application.</p>\r\n                    <p>We also added another option for app checks! Creators will be able to create a ticket on discord to request for an app check.
