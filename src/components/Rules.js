                    <h3>Rules</h3>
                    <p>Rating for this group has reduced down to at least 16+. Although the rating is 16+, we would like for creators to be at least 18 years old. Explicit NSFW will not be allowed in any of the group chats, group galleries, official group hashtags, etc.</p>
                    <p>Genres include slice-of-life, commission/request, free-form, and semi-harvest moon.</p>
                    <p>The group is based on DeviantArt to submit art and Discord to roleplay. These two platforms are mandatory. Expect announcements to be made on Discord, so creators will need to have both accounts.</p>
                    <p>Regarding art, we do not have a very strict policy on how good your art is. But if we catch any form of art theft or art tracing, we will not tolerate it and you will be asked to leave the group.</p>
                    <p>Be patient with and respect the mods and allow time for them to respond. Please move discussion to DMs if the topic becomes uncomfortable. If you are uncomfortable with a conversation you can always tell the chat or the mods. Please keep the chat drama free. If you, by any means, have a conflict with another member for whatever reason, you can discuss with the mods and they will try to come up with a solution.</p>

                    <h3>F.A.Q.</h3>
                    <p><b>›› Is there a member cap?</b><br/>No, but we will only take the maximum capacity of the current job positions available. So if there are more than 3 people applying to be in the job position of Server, we will only look at those with Server job apps to decide. Therefore, you will expect some competition.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p><b>›› Can I use Toyhou.se because I don’t like DeviantArt and I don't use Sta.sh?</b><br/>You are allowed to use Toyhou.se, Google Docs, etc. as you see fit. However, it must be viewable for us. If you use Google Docs, remove access restrictions to the document.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p><b>›› I cannot draw but want to participate, is that possible?</b><br/>This is a half-art half-writing RP group. We want you to be able to write and do art but it will not always be required. There will be writing assignments to earn currencies. Events will mostly require you to participate as a writer. You can draw an RP from an event or from memes we will provide you. We don't want you to simply be a 100% writer so draw frequently (even if it's for practice).</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p><b>›› Can my art application be drawn by someone else?</b><br/>As long as you provide the proper credit of the person who drew the art somewhere in your application. You are allowed to commission an artwork, but we would prefer you to draw it yourself. It doesn't matter if your art is good, your creativity is what makes you different.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p><b>›› Can I create a secondary character?</b><br/>Yes, you can create a secondary character once you have reached a certain level (Intermediate level). You will move up the ranks based on your performance and RP submissions. The fastest way to level up is by completing and submitting commissions/requests from the local village.</p>
                    <p>When you have moved up to another level, you will be given the role to that specific level. Keep in mind that you can only create two characters at the moment so there will not be room for a third character. This all depends on how far the group goes.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p><b>›› Will there be more jobs? Can it be requested if I don't like the ones listed?</b><br/>There will be more jobs available in the future. We will allow room for requests but we have to decide if it fits our group setting.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p><b>›› Will there be activity checks?</b><br/>Yes, and we will probably host them every 6 months. Allow yourself to submit something in those 6 months, even if it is just one RP submission. If you are not active for more than 6 months, we will have no choice but to force you to leave.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p><b>›› Can my character live with someone else?</b><br/>Each character will have their own house. If you want to request to live with another character, the other party must also talk with the mods about this. You need to also provide the reason why you want these two characters to live together. Examples include if characters experience a financial crisis, a change in marital status, etc.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p><b>›› This group seems interesting, can I become a mod?</b><br/>We do not know if our group can go as far as being able to recruit members. However, if we do get people and that we continue to grow with this group, then yes, we can open a position for mods!</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p><b>›› Will there be monsters to fight or will there be any fighting involved?</b><br/>There will be commissions where fighting will be involved! Creatures and monsters won’t be weird types of monsters that appear in anime or games. People are not limited to not being able to fight. How else would we have survived all this way to create a village? People will encounter hardships and obstacles along the way.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p><b>›› To the previous question, will there be magic (for fighting, anything)? Also, the Wisteria tree has magic, correct?</b><br/>Shhh. The Wisteria tree is a powerful source of energy that is able to sustain the village. Its magic is unknown and we will get to learn about it in the future. And to the other question, that can be answered in the future as well...</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p><b>›› Why do I still not understand what this group is about?</b><br/>Trust us, we get it. None of us understand what it’s about half of the time. But all we do know is that it is pretty much a slice-of-life kind of RP group. There will be features of harvest moon, but that’s most definitely left entirely up to your imaginations.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p><b>›› Will there be app checks?</b><br/>We're not going to check if any of the apps are lore compliant since there isn't really any lore in this group. We do ask you to send us an app check to get feedback from us, but don't be discouraged that you don't have the time to submit one. People always don't realize that app checks don't mean they will get accepted even if they did great on both application submissions.</p>
                    <p>When you do submit one, make sure the mods can comment on them. Please read through the comments to understand to the best of your knowledge because it can really help you (more likely to get accepted if you followed what we asked for).</p>
                    <p>If you send a Group Note on DeviantArt, we can directly give you feedback by replying. If you send on Google Docs, we can comment by highlighting a section from the application.</p>
                    <p>We also added another option for app checks! Creators will be able to create a ticket on discord to request for an app check. Once you have created the ticket, a new channel will appear for a one-on-one discussion!</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p><b>›› How will you judge the applications?</b><br/>This is not going to be disclosed for applicants. It will be announced when results are out.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p><b>›› The calculator for currency looks complicated. Can I not calculate how many currencies I will earn and just let the mods do them?</b><br/>The mods can still calculate for you, but we would like it if you calculated them yourselves. While we are processing the submission, we can check if your estimated currency is the right amount or not. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EcEl0NibPxyfNrmhOjKKPF2VK-Bt8iSgT4Yg17ak0aY/edit#gid=0">calculator</a> is supposed to be very easy to use and it does the work for you.</p>
